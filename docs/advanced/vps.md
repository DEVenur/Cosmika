# VPS Deployment

The Docker setup works on any VPS. The one thing to be careful about: **the web dashboard has no login screen**.

## Secure the dashboard port

Do **not** open port `17860` in your VPS firewall. Anyone who can reach it can read and change your Discord token and API keys.

Instead, access the dashboard through an SSH tunnel:

```bash
ssh -L 17860:localhost:17860 user@your-vps-ip
```

Open `http://localhost:17860` in your browser — traffic goes through SSH to your VPS. The port never touches the public internet.

To run the tunnel in the background:

```bash
ssh -fNL 17860:localhost:17860 user@your-vps-ip
```

`-f` sends it to the background; `-N` means "don't run any commands, just forward the port."

## Keeping the bot running

Docker containers stop when the VPS reboots unless you configure Docker to start on login, or use a systemd service. The simplest approach:

```bash
# After reboot, cd to the folder with docker-compose.yml and run:
docker compose start
```

For a production setup, add a `restart` policy to each service in `docker-compose.yml`. Open the file and add `restart: unless-stopped` under each service name:

```yaml
services:
  bot:
    restart: unless-stopped   # add this line
    image: ...
  web:
    restart: unless-stopped   # add this line
    image: ...
```

With `unless-stopped`, containers restart automatically after a reboot unless you explicitly stopped them with `docker compose stop`.
